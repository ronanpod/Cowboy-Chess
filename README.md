# cowboy chess

## How it works

Like chess, except the pawns can capture one's own horse to reach the esteemed rank of cowboy.

## How it moves

While a knight moves one square in one direction followed by two squares in a perpendicular direction, a cowboy can also move one square in one direction followed by three squares in a perpendicular direction.
